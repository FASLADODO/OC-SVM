# One-Class SVM
In [this notebook](https://github.com/Mmiglio/OC-SVM/blob/master/OCSVM.ipynb) there are some experiment I did with One-Class Support Vector Machine.

In the first part I learned how  OC-SVM works using simulated data. Then, in the second part I used a real dataset (It can be downloaded from [here](https://www.openml.org/d/1597)).
